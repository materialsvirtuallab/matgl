class IOMixIn:
    """Mixin class for handling input/output operations for model saving and loading.

    This class provides methods to save initialization arguments and model states,
    serialize the model into files, and load a model from specified paths. It helps
    manage the lifecycle of model-related data, including initialization parameters,
    state dictionaries, and metadata, in a structured and reusable manner.

    The functionality includes:
    - Saving initialization arguments for reproducibility.
    - Serializable save of model state and initialization arguments to disk.
    - Support for saving and populating additional metadata.
    - Loading models and their states from specified paths or pre-trained model sources.

    Usage of this mixin is intended for models requiring serialization of their
    initialization arguments and runtime states. It assumes the model class
    implements and supports PyTorch's state_dict and load_state_dict methods.

        from the `__init__` method of the class, excluding `self` and `__class__`. If an additional

        collected arguments are instances of a subclass of `IOMixIn`, those arguments are serialized
        into a dictionary representation that includes class metadata and initialization arguments.
        Finally, the arguments are stored as an instance variable `_init_args`.
